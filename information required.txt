Code and Detailed report is needed for every step.

1. How many classes you have considered to tackle this problem and how?

2. # of Images: 
 (i) how many original images for Pakistan and UK Id cards
 (ii) how many you have in total after annotations
 (iii) training and test split (how many images for training and how many for test?)

3. What augmentation method/approach you used? 
4. Provide annotation files for all images (original+annotated). 
   Also provide one example original image of UK and PK and its annotation and similarly , one augmented image of both countries with annotation file.


5. Provide all code files (main code +augmentation code).

6. Also mention the piece of code for transfer learning:
     Mention in the report which and how many layers you have removed and on how much data you retrained?

7. Provide detail on all the experiments with training +validation curves.
8. Report accuracy (How many cards were test. How many labels correctly identified and how many were missed for each class type?)
   For example a UK ID  card have 3 labels (id#, name, dob), so you have to mention for each test card that how many were missed. Moreover what were the confidence threshold.

while uploading, for images you can reduce their size, it can be in KBs.
